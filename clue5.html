              <p>
                Throughout all of the historical documents we've found there's one common thread - their society embraced animal companions as if they were members of their own family. The eternals we're no exception to this, and it
                appears they have also had a significant number of companions in their time together. Two in particular stand out - the bonds they shared with these animals appear to have truly left an impact on their lives. While the 
                first companion appears to have passed away at some point in history - the records show he was loved dearly and the eternals showered him with love and affection for their all too brief time together. It left a large hole
                in their hearts, but they were able to mend those wounds and give that love to another companion. However, we aren't really sure what kind of animal the new companion is as he doesn't match the description of other
                creatures within his species. What a puzzling discovery!<br/><br/>

                Maybe we should investigate where the new companion was obtained? Before he joined the eternal's family he was kept in a local business as a performer for the customers. After the eternal's met him they were smitten
                by his charm and energy - despite his poor attitude and frequency to lash out when upset. The records show that the store had a slogan displayed proudly on a banner outside - but alas, it has been lost to time. What is that slogan?!
