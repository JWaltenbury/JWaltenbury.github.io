                    This lab focuses on researching a specific development tool, which is used to develop applications for various architectures.
                    For the purposes of this lab, Xamarin has been selected. This development tool will be broken down and analyzed in the following
                    headings.

                    Xamarin supports iOS, Android, and Windows Phone all in one. The purpose of Xamarin is to make multi-platform development much simpler
                    by creating shared C# code that applies to all of the platforms. While some platform-specific C# is required, the majority of the code
                    can be applied to any of these platforms.

                <p>
                    Xamarin application development is cross-platform, but the actual applications are native. The advantage to this is that native apps
                    allow developers to customize their app to work exactly the way it should on the native device, while also allowing access to the API's
                    of each platform. A disadvantage to this process is that the GUI for each app needs to be designed individually, as none of the apps
                    that get developed are truly multi-platform. As such, while Xamarin is excellent for rapid multi-platform development, it is still
                    important to have experienced developers for each platform to handle the required native code to make the app work properly on the 
                    desired platform.

                    Xamarin is a proprietary technology, created by the company of the same name. The key developers are Nat Friedman and
                    Miguel de Icaza. Xamarin as a company, however, is a subsidiary of Microsoft and was purchased in 2016.

                    While each individual piece of Xamarin has been added over time, the company was founded in 2011. The first part of the
                    development software was released in 2012, which provided support for Mac based applications. It was not until 2013 that
                    the version of Xamarin used in Visual Studio was released, which was Xamarin 2.0.

                    Xamarin itself is free, however you require a Visual Studio license in order to use the tool. Due to the way Visual
                    Studio handles licenses, you can do personal development for free; however, if you plan to sell any applications
                    you must purchase a Professional or Enterprise Visual Studio license.

                    Xamarin uses C# to develop apps on any of the supported platforms. Even where platform-specific code is required,
                    the code must be written in C#. Xamarin strongly recommends C# as the best language for mobile development, stating
                    "Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift, or Java, you can do in C#".

                    As Xamarin is an extension of Visual Studio, the debugger used is built into Visual Studio. Given our experience working with
                    Visual Studio and its prevalence in the software community, this is a very powerful debugging program with a vast list of
                    debugging features not offered in other IDEs.

                    Visual Studio, and by extension Xamarin, offer "pre-configured virtual devices that appear in the device drop-down menu". As 
                    such, using Xamarin allows you to simultaneously develop the application and emulate/test it without having to leave the
                    Visual Studio IDE.

                <p>
                    As outlined previously, the key advantages of using Xamarin is that it allows applications to be developed very quickly
                    since 75% of the code can be applied to multiple platforms. Additionally, since the applications are developed to be
                    native, the GUI designer makes it so that the app will look exactly as expected when distributed to the target devices.
                    Further, Xamarin uses platform-specific hardware acceleration, meaning the app will be as efficient as possible on every
                    platform it is developed for; this also extends to allowing access to native APIs.<br/>

                <p>
                    A key disadvantage of Xamarin is that some native coding is still required in order to finish an application; what this means
                    is that Xamarin based apps are not truly multi-platform. While this slightly increases development time, and requires additional
                    knowledge of each platform, the advantages to using Xamarin outweigh this consequence. Another aspect of Xamarin that could be
                    viewed as a negative is that a paid license of Visual Studio is required to legally profit off of any applications that you develop.

                <p>
                    Since Visual Studio is the core program, there is no commission given to Xamarin in order to upload and sell an app using this tool.
                    However, as mentioned previously, a paid license of Visual Studio is required in order to legally distribute applications you have
                    developed beyond the scope of personal use. A Community (free) license can be used to distrubute applications for personal or
                    open source use, but any attempt to make profit requires a premium license.

                <p>
                    Since Xamarin uses Visual Studio as its foundation, third-party emulators are not incorporated into the tool. Visual Studio provides
                    an extensive library of emulators that can be used, ranging from phones to tablets to laptops. Within each type, Visual Studio also
                    allows you to emulate using specific versions of a specific platform's OS. As such, Xamarin does not require third-party emulation;
                    in fact, the whole point of Xamarin is to eliminate the need to use additional tools.

                    The exact number of applications developed using Xamarin remains unknown. Since the apps are developed to be
                    supported on the native platform, it is difficult to isolate apps which were developed using Xamarin as opposed
                    to those developed using the native development tools. Xamarin's website also does not provide an estimate of
                    a possible number either.
