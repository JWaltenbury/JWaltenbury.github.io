              <p>
                  We're coming to the end, I'm running out of gifts. I didn't think you would get this far detective. And I would have gotten away with it too,
                  if it weren't for you meddling kids and your dumb dog. This clue will lead you to your last gift, which I hope you like. I love you a lot
                  and hope you have an amazing birthday.<br/><br/>

                  The final clue:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Tools are handy, and help us a lot</li>
                      <li>Too bad that thumbs for the pets can't be bought</li>
                      <li>This tool is big, and reaches great heights</li>
                      <li>But the crap that gets stored on it causes fights</li>
                      <li>It's not a real tool, this one is fake</li>
                      <li>The worst part is its the type you have to make</li>
                      <li>I know this one is hard, but I think you can do it</li>
                      <li>The password will require you to count every little bit...</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>

              <h2>Password:</h2>
              <p class = "media" id="errorMessage">
                Please enter the password below:<br/>
