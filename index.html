              <h3>Happy Birthday Laura!</h3>

              <p>
                  This year, we're going to once again try something new. You love crime shows so much, that I thought it would be fun to kidnap your gifts and hold them hostage.
                  Now why would I do that when it's your birthday? Because sometimes the best things in life take some work - like dating me!<br/><br/>

                  The system will still work the same, and you must follow the clues to your prize. However, finding the gift will not be enough. I won't be putting clues with the
                  gifts this time! You must use the clues I provide, combined with the gift you find, to determine the password to get to the next page.<br/><br/>

                  I hope you that you enjoy this little game I've put together, and that you have an amazing birthday. I love you with all my heart, and can't wait to spend
                  another year with you. Happy Birthday! <br/><br/>

                  Let's start off easy to access your first clue:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Please enter the most common password in the world</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>

              <h2>Password:</h2>
              <p class = "media" id="errorMessage">
                Please enter the password below:<br/>
              </p>
              <form>
                    User Name: <input type="text" name="password1" id="password1" value=""/><br/>
                </form>
                <div id="centerbuttons">
                    <input type="button" value="Submit" id="submitButton" onClick="submitCredentials1()" name="submitButton"/>
                    <input type="reset"/>
                </div>
