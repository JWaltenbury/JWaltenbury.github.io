              <p>
                A royal feast! Not with knights and swords, but with meat and potatoes! The eternals had a tradition where they would go out yearly to celebrate spending another year in the company of each other. It is rather unfortunate 
                that these feasts are such an expense to prepare - imagine a world where one could feast like this regularly. It's possible that our novice explorer mixed up some of the records, but we've also found tell of a musician 
                that the eternals both enjoyed. From what we can tell he was a solo entertainer that had the skills and charisma to entertain entire stadiums of people!<br/><br/>

                Somehow, the yearly feast and the musician have collided. We're not sure if it's true or if our records are wrong - we need you to investigate! The musician released many mathematically themed compilations of songs, and 
                it appears the host of the feast advocates for one of them. Can you figure out which album it is?
