              <p>
                What a fascinating discovery! We've just found a record of a long journey the eternals went on - perhaps a pilgrimage! As a means of saving a few dollars the eternals went on a multiple hour long hike from one end
                of the city to another. They marched alongside friends for hours, simply because they didn't want to request the aid of a local carriage. And to top it all of off they did this in the middle of the night. What a 
                harrowing experience this must have been! I can't imagine doing something so reckless in this day and age. If only I could have experienced the despair in their eyes upon having the carriage money revoked upon their return! All for nothing!<br/><br/>

                At the start of their great journey they passed a park. The park itself seems to have a medieval archway upon which it's name has been proudly displayed. We can't make out the name of the park from the images we have access to,
                so we need you to travel there and obtain it. Be careful though - traffic reports indicate this is a very busy area and this will be a tricky excursion. You're going to need to collect the information on the move and send 
                it to us once you've found a safe stopping place. Now go get us the name of that park!
