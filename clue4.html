                One thing the eternals were known for was their dedication to supporting the community around them - especially when it came to their local tavern! Despite a global pandemic this dynamic duo made the painful sacrifice
                of eating food in their pajamas in the comfort of their own home. The eternals have been such a boon for the tavern that they even helped them survive the great pickle famine that devastated many eateries in the area.
The eternals are truly dedicated to their closest companions and regularly bring them to their local tavern in preparation for future adventures. While the tavern itself hasn't been of any significant note - the role it has
                played as a safe haven during many other experiences and tribulations makes it a place we'd like to study further. <br/><br/>

                What we want to figure out is how the tavern has survived this long. We know the eternals supported it through a pandemic and pickle famine, but there are numerous records of bird swarms in that era. Somehow this
                tavern has kept these birds away - it's almost like there are stalwart guardians protecting it! If you were to keep all the birds away, I wonder how many guardians it would take...
