              Hello explorer! We're going on an adventure today! This is going to be a special expedition - we're going to try to find artifacts related to the history of this area. Our initial findings show that
               the people that came before us participated in many events and stories. We're going to call them "The Eternals". We want to catalogue everything so it doesn't get lost to time!<br/><br/>

               The plan for this expedition is to hop in our trusty blimp and traverse the city looking for the answer to many of history's greatest mysteries. We're going to give you the background we've been able
               to discover so far, and it's up to you to fill in the gaps! Here, let's try the first one we found - we're going to need to do some field work to solve these puzzles.

              <b>Artifact 1:</b>
              <p>
                  The first time the eternals met was at a local inn where people go to holiday. Its been lost to time, but the area has been repurposed by another corporation. One of the eternals was banished during the celebration, but during that meeting it was mentioned that the other eternal
                  wasn't actually short, and was quite tall. We were wondering, what kind of <b>clearance</b> would this location have in present day? Let's focus on just the feet portion of the clearance.
