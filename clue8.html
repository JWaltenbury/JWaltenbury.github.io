              <b>Artifact 8:</b>
              <p>
                I'm exhausted! All this travelling has really taken a toll, and I'm not even the one solving the clues! The next artifact I've picked out is a lot closer to home - it's near another park. Sheesh, these eternals sure did 
                do a lot of stuff at parks. It's kind of weird how into activities and sports they were! The records we've got on the next artifact talk about some long lost object called a "baseball". It's mentioned as a stand-alone 
                sport, but also combined with something called "soccer" to make a hybrid. What a strange society! There's even records indicating a horrifying accident where one of the eternals struck the other with a ball and gave
                them stiches on their leg! Wait... <b>on</b> their leg? Stiches go <b>in</b> the skin don't they? Maybe the documents are wrong...<br/><br/>

                I'm sick of looking at parks, so this time let's get data on something else. There's a building near that park that appears to operate in a similar manner of one of the eternal's professions. It's a place where the adults of
                society banished the children throughout the week and left them to fend for themselves. From what we've heard these places turn into something akin the wild west - a lawless world where the children seem to turn feral.
                The thought of going anywhere near a containment facility like this terrifies me - so all I need is the street number for the building. I'll send out a braver crew than myself later to explore!
